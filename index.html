        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Dr. Mary Janet Arnado</strong> is a Filipino Sociologist featured by the ISA as the Sociologist of the Month for April 2022 for her article
        <i><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00113921211034900">Structured inequalities and authors' positionalities in academic publishing: The case of Philippine international migration scholarship.</a></i>
        She attained a Doctorate of Philosophy in Sociology at Virginia Tech, a Masters of arts on Health Social Science at De La Salle University in Manilla, and both a Bachelor
        of Science in Development Communication and a Masters of Arts in Sociology and Anthropology at Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro.
        She specializes in countless sociological fields, including but not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Globalization and Gendered Migration</li>
            <li>Natural Resources</li>
            <li>Violent conflicts and internal conflicts</li>
            <li>Colonialism and Filipina feminism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Her flagship article discussed the differences in influence, citation, and otherwise attention given to articles published by Filipino authors,
            notably being categorized by difference of their accuited institutions of publication, being either a Philippine-based institution or a external, 
            overseas journal publication. The study found that those who are institutionally affiliated with the Global North dominate in terms of publication
            count and especially citation, while at the same gain network-mediated benefits.</p>

        <p>The implications of these findings suggest that social structures limit the possibilities of people, and that migration is not only life-changing in terms
            of one's line of work, but at the same time creates constraints that actively inhibit those who choose not to, or do not have the ability to, leave for the Global
            North. This positionality theory, where the "insiders" (in this case those who migrated) inadvertently create issues for the "outsiders" by virtue of existing
            is present in many different cases and line of work around the world, but is especially prevalent when it comes to third world countries such as the Philippines.
