        <h3>"Is this site made by AI?"</h3>
        <p><strong>absolutely not</strong></p>
        <p>This site is lovingly handcrafted with extremely poorly designed code from yours truly while I listen to the VA-11 HALL-A soundtrack. If for some reason you don't believe me,
            you can check my <a href="https://github.com/poyowo/sociologyproject">Github page that i don't use nearly as often as I should.</a> I promise you, no deep learning method could learn
            to do it like me because I just sucks that badly.</p>
        <h3>"Why did you pick this sociologist?"</h3>
        <p>To be honest, my original plan was to pick a sociologist that focused on gender fluidity or similar due to a preexisting knowledge on the topic, but when I found that there were no applicable
            sociologists, my next best bet in terms of first person knowledge would come from any studies regarding the Philippines, the country of my herritage. Arnado stood out to me because her study was 
            in many ways a parallel to the experiences my parents had gone through when immigrating to the United States. They recieved overall better opportunities in the west, and while they ultimately had 
            to sacrifice seeing their families for lengthy gaps of time, they decided that the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
