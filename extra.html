        <p><strong>absolutely not</strong></p>
        <p>This site is lovingly handcrafted with extremely poorly designed code from yours truly while I listen to the VA-11 HALL-A soundtrack. If for some reason you don't believe me,
            you can check my <a href="https://github.com/poyowo/sociologyproject">Github page that i don't use nearly as often as I should.</a> I promise you, no deep learning "AI" could learn
            to do it like me because I just sucks that badly.</p>
