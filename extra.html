        <h3><u>"Is this site made by AI?"</u></h3>
        <p><strong>absolutely not</strong></p>
        <p>This site is lovingly handcrafted with extremely crappy code from yours truly while I listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5K0btWIGmA89LTJ5zDM3Hn?si=wTbvUOkkTqGJ6YIsBoJrEA">
            Constant Companions</a> (if you like breakbeats you should listen to it too). If for some reason you don't believe me, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/poyowo/sociologyproject">
            Github page that I don't use nearly as often as I should.</a> I promise you, no deep learning method could learn to do it like me because I just suck that badly.</p>
        <h3><u>"Why did you pick this sociologist?"</u></h3>
        <p>To be honest, my original plan was to pick a sociologist that focused on gender fluidity or similar due to a preexisting knowledge on the topic, but when I found that there were no applicable
            sociologists, my next best bet in terms of first person knowledge would come from any studies regarding the Philippines, the country of my herritage. Arnado stood out to me because her study was 
            in many ways a parallel to the experiences my parents had gone through when immigrating to the United States. They recieved overall better opportunities in the west, and while they ultimately had 
            to sacrifice seeing their families for lengthy gaps of time, they decided that the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
        <p><strong>i know you're totally asking this so</strong></p>
        <h3><u>"oh my god marco you're so cool and totally awesome what fighting games do you play"</u></h3>
        <p>FINALLY A QUESTION THAT MATTERS! Right now I've been playing a ton of anime fighters (a subgenere of fightng games) like Guilty Gear Strive and Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising (which to be honest, doesn't really count), 
            though I've been looking into getting into some more technical games like Street Fighter 6 or Under-Night In-Birth System:Celestial (yes thats its actual name). If you're wondering what types of characters I play, (because I know
            this has been on your mind since <i>forever</i>) I'm a huge fan of the grappler archtype in almost every game, but outside of that I enjoy playing characters with great pressure, strong rushdown, or
            a mixture of both. This reflects in my mains across different series, such as Potemkin, Vira, Zangief, and Mika among others.
